My name is River, a boringly ordinary college student that loves Psychology.
Life is the most unpredictable thing, my grandma Evelyn used to say. Everyone knows her as a great psychologist, but to me, she was just an amazing grandma.
The 16th of March is the first day of my school break. It’s also on that day, I walked into the Heathsville Forest without a plan, all because of a stupid email. 
What I didn’t know back then, is that this day would change my life forever.
