Hey River,

I heard that you are struggling for a decent job. You may not know who I am, but I have a <b>big offer</b> here. <b>Gah-hah-hah!</b>

As far as I know, you're not interested in Management work at all. You have been a <b>psychology fan</b> since very little. Quit the boring work and be a <b>mental therapist</b> in my organization, <b>Solarpunk Academy</b>!

I know you have <b>special talents</b>, and so do you. Whatever those big names pay you, <b>I will double the price</b>. 

I attached our location in the email. Come to us, and we will talk more about it! <b>GAH-HAH-HAH!!</b>

Sincerely,
Your friend Jagger.
Solarpunk Academy
